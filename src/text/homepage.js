export const HELLO = "Hello! I’m Natalie. I study the physiology, molecular ecology, and functional diversity of marine microbes, with a special interest in how they respond to environmental stress. This December, I am beginning a new appointment as an Assistant Professor in Biological Oceanography at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography and University of Georgia Department of Marine Sciences. I received my PhD from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Department of Marine Sciences, and I am currently a Simons Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution."
export const HELLO2 = "I aim to explore how variations in trace metal supplies influence metal metabolism among diverse groups of protists through a combination of field-based community experiments, lab-based culture analyses, and environmental bioinformatic processing. By linking the concentrations of bioactive trace metals such as dissolved iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) with gene and protein expression patterns, I hope to better understand the clever strategies phytoplankton have evolved for subsisting across biogeochemically distinct and highly complex marine environments."
