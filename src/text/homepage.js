export const HELLO = "Hello! I’m Natalie. I study the physiology, molecular ecology, and functional diversity of marine microbes, with a special interest in how they respond to environmental stress. This December, I am beginning a new appointment as an Assistant Professor in Biological Oceanography at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography and University of Georgia Department of Marine Sciences. I received my PhD from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Department of Marine Sciences, and I am currently a Simons Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution."
